                    •	Proactively monitor, track, manage and measure search engine marketing strategies and promote the marketing of the Client’s products and/or services on the Website(s) (and all successor or replacement sites thereto);<br/>
                    •	Manage the relationships with and payments to the possessors, owners,  operators and/or administrators of the applicable search engines or directories (“Search Partners”);<br/>
                    •	Manage offer price, listing conditions, monthly expenditure, adding and removing listings, generating new listings and changing bid quota;<br/>
                    •	Provide, monitor and maintain the essential technology applications needed to link the Website(s) to Search Partners; and<br/>
                    •	Track and report certain metrics including the total number of clicks, sales conversion data and ROI measurements and, if appropriate to the Agency’s fees, track and report the nature and amount of all relevant actions as recognized in the MSA by Qualified Customers (as defined below).<br/>
                    
                    <h5>Payment for PSM Services</h5> 
                    The fees placed out in the Service Agreement are exclusive of any application program interface (“API”) similar fees that a Search Partner may levy to the Agency in connection with the Client’s search marketing program.  The Agency reserves the right to charge the Client (and the Client agrees to pay) the quantity of such fees. Where such Search Partners assess a specific cost-per-click charge, that cost will be billed by the Agency to the Client.  In occasions where a Search Partner charges the Agency a flat fee for API access, the Agency shall pass all such API fees to its PSM clients on a pro-rata basis. For purposes of explanations, in such instances, the Agency shall use commercially sensible efforts to determine the rough effective API cost on a per-click basis for all applicable clients. Each such client would then be charged its proportionate part of the API expense. 
                    
                    <h5>Responsibilities of Client</h5><br/>

The Client agrees and acknowledges that a Search Partner may, in its sole discretion, refuse to display or continue to display any of the Client’s Offers and that neither the Agency nor any Search Partner would be answerable for such refusal.<br/>
                    c)	The Client would be only responsible for all characteristics of the relationship with all persons and/or entities that buy Products or submit a registration, as the case may be, including without limitation:<br/>

The Agency shall provide the Client with a one-by-one (1×1) clear pixel (the “Image Tag”) to allow for tracking by the Agency. The Client will not take any action with respect to this Image Tag that would obstruct with the Agency’s ability to carry out its tasks under this Agreement and will provide reasonable advance notice to the Agency of any activity reasonably anticipated to have such effect. <br/>
